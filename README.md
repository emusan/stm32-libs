# STM32F4 Library compiler (mostly for use with my other projects)

Some may have noticed that instead of building the libraries with every project there is simply a libstm32.a file included (along with a few others), but most of the ST library itself has been chucked out.

This is done in order to conserve space and because one does not really need to build the libraries with the project.

I have created this as a means of letting others create these libstm32.a files as well as to allow for easier library upgrades (not that such a thing is entirely necessary at this point).

Anyway, this comes with no license whatsoever for what I have done (the Makefile), Of course STM's libraries have their own various licenses that you should read, accept, and abide by before even touching this software!

If this helps you in any way let me know!

# ENJOY!
